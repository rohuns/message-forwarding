goal: be able to send text messages from any phone and then have those be sent from an iMessage account


current hypothesis:

text -> intercept -> send to server -> applescript -> imessage


[x] starting with the applescript -> imessage part


open threads
- how ot do this for group messages
- how do i forward back any texts that im getting
	- specifically that it will come from central location in the current manifestation

- maybe i need to look into actually intercepting text messsages from/to Apple
